EDP Capstone Final Winter Quarter 2021

This git project contains the Unity folder for my EDP Capstone - listed as Prototype1
This project also contains a build for Android phones - listed as FinalCapstoneV1.apk

To view the project you can download the "Prototype 1" folder and use Unity Hub to open the project folder. 
The folders are a mess, but everything should be working properly!

The best way to explore the space is to press play in the Unity editor, then change the location and rotation of
the AR Session Origin Camera object in order to see the different rooms in the "Game" view
You can also move around in the Unity editor while in Play mode and explore the different rooms. 
If you want to attempt to create an iOS build, go for it!

Best of luck and I hope you enjoy the project!
